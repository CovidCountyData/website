                        The COVID Modeling Data Collaborative is a collection of
                        people, code, and data meant to help researchers, policy
                        makers, and any interested parties access data that can
                        be used to analyze and influence public policy related
                        to the current pandemic.

                        This project is meant as a public good and, for as long
                        as the project continues, it will be free and

                        We don't. We, and our partners and sponsors, want to
                        enable policy discussions that are rooted in accurate,
                        comprehensive, easy-to-access data. We are lucky enough
                        to have an opportunity to facilitate this.

                        All over. We collect the data from a variety of sources.
                        You can learn more about where each dataset comes from
                        by reading the <a href="/rest-api">API documentation</a>
                        . We use official government sources where possible.

                        Tell us! We're trying to rapidly expand the datasets
                        that we have available in our API and would love to hear
                        about the data that you need! You can find us on

                        <li>
                          You can interact with the data using our

                          <a href="/R">R client</a>. This route will hide much
                          of the behind-the-scenes work and get you working with
                          the data quickly.

                          You can directly query our
                          <a href="/rest-api">REST API</a> which will give you
                          more control on how to bring the data into your
                          environment.

                          which is another option that gives you a high degree

                        We think the Python and R libraries will be enough for
                        most people, but we wanted to make sure to expose the
                        other options as well.
